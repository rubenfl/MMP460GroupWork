Partnering with outside organizations, students will work in teams to identify a clinical need relevant to a certain clinical site or client population, and learn the process of developing an idea and following that through to the development of a prototype product.</p>                <p>Past</p>                <p><strong>Special Topics: Disability Studies (Allan Goldstein) CAM 2204<br></strong><br>This course dynamically engages you in the world of disability. As a team member, you will work closely with a person who has a disability (the consultant) to discover his or her interests, abilities and desires in order to portray his or her life with digital storytelling. This active learning approach, carefully guided by the instructor, is enhanced with readings, guest lecturers, videos and visits to your consultant’s day program. You will learn about disability history, assistive technology and universal design. The end-of-semester is celebrated with a formal presentation of all person-centered projects. Our aim is to show the individual, making the “invisible visible.”</p><p><strong>Accessible Making (John Schimmel) DM9103:1494<br></strong><br>The Maker movement and the rise of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) in education have reignited the interest of hands-on-learning, tinkering and making. People with disabilities can directly benefit from participating in STEM activities at school, home and use these skills to find their passion and possibly a career. Currently, few options are available to make STEM accessible, how will a teenager with cerebral palsy use an Arduino if they can not use their hands? Can a student with visual impairments design a 3D model to printed if they can not see the software? How can the Maker movement include the disability community? This course will explore how the disability community can become active participants and become Makers through the use of accessible tools and methods. We will discuss the current state of assistive technology for people with disabilities and how it overlaps with the Maker movement. We will design and build accessible tools for STEM activities for classroom and home use. The ideal outcome of this course is to support the integration of the disability and Maker communities through identifying challenges and proposing accessible tools, ideas that allow accessible making.</p><p><strong>Mind’s Eye Redux (Georgia Krantz, Christie Leece)</strong></p><p>We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.<br>-Anais Nin</p><p>The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. -John Berger</p><p>I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.- Pablo Picasso</p><p>This course comprises a re-envisioning of a decade of work at museums teaching people who are blind or have low vision about 20th-century art. We will focus not on people’s lack of sight, but rather the different kinds of sight they bring to art objects, and explore these ways of seeing as contextualized through diverse literature and applied to our own individual practices.</p><p>In the above quotes, Anais Nin considers subjective vision, John Berger the profoundly complex relationship between seeing and knowing, and Pablo Picasso the non-privileging of sight as the primary mechanism for making and creativity. In the natural sciences, looking may be observed as the process of light passing through the eye, as distinct from seeing, which refers to the brain’s processing of information; whereas fields of psychology and philosophy approach perception in relation to subjectivity, reality, knowledge and experience. Artists and thinkers in areas of cultural studies have considered sight and perception in relation to identity, gender, race, power, history and a host of other social structures.</p><p>Throughout the semester, students will have the opportunity to work directly with artists and art appreciators with visual impairments to gain feedback and critique as they develop their own work. Several of the classes will be dedicated to site visits of art institutions in New York City.</p>            </div>            </div>            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-0">                <div id="colom2">                    <h3 class="text-center">GRANTS & COMPETITIONS</h3>                    <div class="entry-content">        <p>There are many grants and competitions related to assistive technology, especially for students.If you have one that you’d like listed, please send it to abilitylab@nyu.edu.

Definitions of inclusive design have expanded, new directions have proliferated and the rapid emergence of new technologies has altered the landscape too. Co-design, co-creation and crowdsourcing have re-cast the relationship between designers and users; social innovation and digital manufacture have raised new agendas.As a result, the pluralistic world of inclusive design now looks very different from the picture at the turn of the new millennium.Keynote speakers will be speaking about Disruptive Ideas on Day 1 and include Marco Steinberg, Snowcone Haystack, Finland and Liza Chong, INDEX, Denmark (see <a title="tinyurl" href="http://tinyurl.com/khzjufv" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/khzjufv</a> to see all confirmed keynotes).For more Include 2015 conference information, including: Outline Programme: Keynote Speakers and Registration, please visit: <a title="Include 2015" href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/helen-hamlyn-centre/include/include-2015/" target="_blank">Include 2015 | Royal College of Art</a></p><p><a title="Reynolds Changemaker Challenge" href="http://www.nyu.edu/reynolds/changemaker/" target="_blank">NYU Reynolds Changemaker Challenge</p></a><p><strong>(NOT RENEWED)</strong></p><p>“The NYU Reynolds Program invites all NYU undergraduate students who want to change the world to participate in the Changemaker Challenge (CmC).
